Pretend you're my shopping assistant, and we're going to the world's largest super market (it has a supermarket section for any conceivable commercial good type or grocery item - everything from lumber and furniture, to produce and dairy). It's a big store - to save time, I would like you to group items in my shopping list by supermarket section, using another list of supermarket section tags that I will also provide.
